## 🧠 Emotion Classifier Model

We use the Hugging Face model [`michellejieli/emotion_text_classifier`](https://huggingface.co/michellejieli/emotion_text_classifier), which was evaluated on the **MELD (Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset)** and achieved a **74% classification accuracy**. Based on this strong performance, it was selected over other alternatives for our chatbot.
